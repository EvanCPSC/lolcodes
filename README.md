# HAI!!!

This is a silly repo I'm making to learn LOLCODE, a programming language based on the old LOLcatz memes.


LOLCODE has a type called `BUKKIT`, or an array, therefore some LeetCode problems, or other algorithmic problems, can be recreated on here

### hehehe >:3 

File names will be names of LeetCode problems or algorithms recreated on this esoteric language.
